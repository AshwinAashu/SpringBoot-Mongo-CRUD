# SpringBoot-Mongo-CRUD
This mini project was aimed at getting started with Springboot and performing basic CRUD operation on a local MongoDB collection. 
The CRUD implementation was used to create, read, update and delete the login credential data ( a key value pair of username and password). 

I extended this project by adding a ReactJS frontend which can be found <a href="https://github.com/AshwinAashu/Simple-react-login">here</a>  :   

Things I learnt from this mini project :
- Basics of Spring MVC and Springboot 
- Understanding and using spring initializer 
- Basics of MongoDB 
- Basic Implementation of MVC architecture 
- Connecting Springboot to MongoDB 
- Using Postman to perform basic api testing
- Using Axios to implement HTTP requests from the frontend to the backend
